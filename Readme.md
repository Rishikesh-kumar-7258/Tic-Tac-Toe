#  Tic‑Tac‑Toe (with AI Opponent)

A classic browser-based **Tic‑Tac‑Toe** game crafted with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, featuring both **two-player** and **player vs. computer (AI)** modes via a search-based algorithm. This project provides interactive gameplay and demonstrates fundamental game logic and basic AI integration.

##  Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**
  - Two-player mode allowing alternating turns between **X** and **O**.
  - **VS Computer (AI)** mode where the player competes against an algorithm—enhancing complexity and challenge.

- **Game Mechanics**
  - Automatic **win detection** with visual notification of the winner.
  - **Draw detection** when all cells are filled and no winner emerges.
  - **Game reset** functionality for quick restarts.

- **User Interface**
  - Interactive 3×3 grid of buttons for cell interaction.
  - Turn tracking ensures players alternate correctly.
  - Win/capture logic blocks further moves once a game ends.

##  How It Compares to Other Tic‑Tac‑Toe Implementations

| Feature               | This Project                         | Common Implementations                         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Tech Stack           | HTML, CSS, JavaScript                | Same—foundational web tech                     |
| AI Opponent          | Yes—basic search-based AI            | Many only offer two-player mode                |
| Win Detection        | Yes—pattern-based checks             | Standard practice in most versions             |
| Reset Functionality  | Yes—resets board and UI              | Common but varies in implementation            |
| Learning Potential   | High—introduces game logic and basic AI | Often limited to UI or tutorial-level code     |

##  What Makes This Project Stand Out

1. **Built-in AI Opponent**  
   While many web-based Tic‑Tac‑Toe games offer only two-player functionality, this version includes a computer opponent implemented through a search algorithm. This elevates it beyond simple tutorials and makes it more engaging for solo players.

2. **Balanced Complexity**  
   It retains an approachable design ideal for beginners learning front-end interaction and game logic, yet incorporates AI behavior to offer depth and learning opportunities.

3. **Foundation for Expansion**  
   The AI model lays the groundwork for progressive enhancements—such as Minimax algorithm, alpha-beta pruning, or difficulty levels in future iterations.

##  Related Examples & Inspirations

- **Basic Vanilla JS Versions**  
  Projects that solely rely on turn-based cell marking, win detection, and reset logic—without any AI—serve as foundational examples for this implementation.

- **Minimax-based AI Games**  
  More advanced Tic‑Tac‑Toe versions use algorithms like Minimax for near-perfect computer play. This project serves as a stepping stone toward such capabilities.

- **React / Mobile Variants**  
  Some community implementations, especially in React or React Native, integrate features like move history tracking, state management, and mobile-friendly layouts—demonstrating broader architectural possibilities.
